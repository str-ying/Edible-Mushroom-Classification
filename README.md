# Edible-Mushroom-Classification

The goal of this project is to develop multiple classification models and find the best performing model that can classify whether a mushroom is edible or not.
The data was gathered by combining two datasets and then preprocessed for training. The models developed were binary classification models such as KNN and Decision Tree. 
Each model was tuned to find the most optimal versions of each model. Tuning methods such as GridSearchCV, n_estimators, and loops were used to tune these models. 
To validate the models and compare them, we used metrics such as accuracy and Cohenâ€™s kappa.
